# University Projects

This section contains all of the projects developed throughout my degree in Computer Engineering at Francisco de Vitoria University, from 2018 to 2024.

> Since Francisco de Vitoria University is in Spain, all of the projects are in spanish.

## Contents

Here are the contents of this section, organized chronologically.

### Convolution Parallelized

Lab from the subject of High Performance Computing, where we implement an image convolution algorithm and then we show the differences in perfomance between the parallelized and non-parallelized versions.

This section has __1__ notebook(s).

### Self-Organized Maps

First lab from the subject Artificial Intelligence II, where we create a Kohonen Map that allows us to cluster 100 colors.

> Special thanks to _Cristian Sevilla_ for the data preprocessing

This section has __1__ notebook(s).

### Perceptron & MLP

Second lab from the subject Artificial Intelligence II, where we create a both a Perceptron and a Multi-Layered Perceptron. We display the capabilities of both in the first 2 notebooks (with trivial examples) and we use an MLP for a "real-world" problem.

This section has __3__ notebook(s).

### Convolutional Networks

Third lab from the subject Artificial Intelligence II, where we create a CNN network for ASL letters image prediction.

This section has __1__ notebook(s).

### Genetic Algorithm

Last lab from the subject Artificial Intelligence II, where we create a genetic algorithm about optimizing a subway 's route.

This section has __1__ notebook(s).
