## Author

My name is Alonso Moreno, but you can call me ___ph0nsy___.

I am on the verge of completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and have a deep passion for Game Development, Artificial Intelligence and a wide range of other subjects. And, just like anyone who is passionate about something, I also love learning and sharing my enthusiasm and knowledge about them with others.

This repository is a product of that passion, an archive that me (or anybody else) can access anytime to look back on some projects or to check if I have doubts about something I have already done.

Feel free to check or use anything here and, of course, have fun with it!

## Collaborators
